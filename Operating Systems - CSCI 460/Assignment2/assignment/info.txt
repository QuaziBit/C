0: type in terminal: ./Makefile or make to compile application

1: if make file is not working for some reason type these in terminal:
   :: gcc -c p_simulation.c
   :: gcc -o p_simulation p_simulation.o -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

2: after compilation run application:
   :: ./p_simulation n k d d_percentage sc
   # -> n = number of processes
   # -> k = max arrival time 
   # -> d = average total CPU time
   # -> d_percentage = fixed percentage of d for standard deviation v
   # -> sc = simulation circles
   Here is example:
   :: ./p_simulation 10 10 100 85.0 10
